# predict-blockbuster
At this project a comprehensive model is developed in order to predict local box-office receipts of any movie screened in the U.S. prior to its official released date using open data sources.

### Data Acquisition
Most of the movie data is acquired using several Application Programming Interfaces as well as through screen scraping of two specialized open data sources: The International Movie Database and The Numbers. Some auxiliary information is also extracted from Box Office Mojo and Fxtop websites.

### Feature Enineering
`as`
This data is then used to engineer multiple important movie features that are responsible for the variation in box-office receipts of different movies.

### Predictive Modelling


** The provided code is generated by myself. Since the presented project was a team project, only the code that was developed bymyseld is presented. That is, code regarding actor and director data and features as well as twitter data is not presented. However, the concept behind the aforementioned features is explained in the detailed report and the final generated dataset is provided in the `jjkjkj` file.
